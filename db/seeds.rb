  {title: "Super Smash Bros", author_id: 1, description: "Super Smash Bros., originally released in Japan as Nintendo All Star! Dairantō Smash Brothers, is a fighting game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999, and in Europe on November 19, 1999. Super Smash Bros. is the first game in the Super Smash Bros. series, followed by Super Smash Bros. Melee for GameCube in 2001, Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Wii in 2008, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS then Super Smash Bros. for Wii U in 2014.\n\nThe game is a crossover between many different Nintendo franchises such as Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Yoshi, Mother, F-Zero, Star Fox, Kirby and Pokémon. It received mostly positive reviews from the media and was commercially successful, selling over 5 million copies worldwide by 2001, with 2.93 million sold in the United States and 1.97 million copies sold in Japan.\n\nThe Super Smash Bros. series is a departure from many fighting games; instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100%, with a maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, many suspended in an otherwise empty space. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time recovering than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying.", developer: "Hal Laboratory", release_date: "April 26, 1999", rating: "10+"},

The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn.\n\nPlayers purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more.", developer: "Hidden Path Entertainment, Valve Corporation", release_date: "August 21, 2012", rating: "M"},

In the most popular game modes, the goal is to destroy the opposing team's \"nexus\", a building which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends game is discrete, with all champions starting off each game fairly weak and progressing by accumulating gold and experience over the course of the game.\n\nLeague of Legends is a 3D, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. In League of Legends, human or AI-controlled players each control a character, called a champion, and form two opposing teams.[10] In the most popular \"classic\" mode, each team begins with a central building, called a nexus, protected by defensive structures. The object of each game is to breach the opposing team's base and destroy their nexus. Each nexus will also occasionally spawn weak, autonomous attackers called \"minions\" that travel along paths called \"lanes\" toward the enemy base. Between the lanes lies an area called the \"jungle\", where neutral monsters reside that can be killed by both teams.", developer: "Riot Games", release_date: "October 27, 2009", rating: "E"},
  {title: "Defense of the Ancients 2", author_id: 1, description: "Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. The player commands one of 110 controllable character \"Heroes\". Each Hero begins the match at level one and becomes more powerful by accumulating experience points through combat, thereby leveling up to the maximum level of twenty-five. With every level gained the player either selects a new ability for their Hero to learn or enhance their general statistics. Each Hero's method of combat is influenced by its primary property: Strength, Agility, or Intelligence.\n\nEach match of Dota 2 takes place on a functionally symmetrical map that features the strongholds of two warring factions, the Radiant and the Dire. The Radiant is based at the southwest corner of the map, while the Dire is based at the northeast corner; the two sides are divided by a river that runs perpendicular to the central lane. These factions are defended by up to five players. In each stronghold is a critical structure called the \"Ancient\", a fountain that provide health and lesser structures. These bases are connected by three paths, referred to as \"lanes\"—two run alongside the edges of the map, while one runs directly between the two bases. The lanes are guarded by defensive Towers, as well as autonomous characters called \"creeps\", which periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes, attacking enemies they encounter. Featured across the map are hostile characters referred to as \"neutrals\", which are not aligned to either faction and are primarily located in the forests (primarily referred to as \"the jungle\" in the game, hence the term \"jungler\" for one who attacks neutral creeps in the jungle). Located in a tarn on the Dire side of the east part of the river is a neutral creep \"boss\" called \"Roshan\", who typically requires multiple team members to kill and drops the powerful item \"Aegis of Immortality\", and significant amounts of gold and experience.\n\nDota 2 features items, which the player stores in an inventory. These items are acquired predominantly through purchase with gold, the in-game currency. Items vary in function: some enhance the statistics of a Hero, while others grant additional abilities. The player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously, though they can obtain more by destroying enemies. Killing non-player characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow, whereas killing enemy Heroes grants gold to the player's nearby allies as well. Destroying Towers or killing Roshan gives gold to all players on the team. \"Denying\" is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemy's ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so.", developer: "Valve Corporation", release_date: "July 9, 2013", rating: "M"},
  {title: "Heroes of the Storm", author_id: 1, description: "Heroes of the Storm revolves around online 5-versus-5 matches, operated through Blizzard's online gaming service Battle.net. Players can choose from three game modes, which include playing with/against computer-controlled heroes or other players. When players first start the game, they may play 5 heroes provided by the free hero rotation, a methodically selected list that changes weekly, but by using gold, the in-game source of wealth, or through microtransactions, they can gain permanent access to a hero. Two additional heroes are available to players who have reached level 15. As of July 2015, there are currently 39 heroes in the game divided into 4 separate roles. Of the currently released maps, 6 of the 8 have the standard 3 main lanes where players can fight, while the others have only two main lanes, but a separate objective-based area. Killing enemy/neutral units and the opposing side's heroes grants experience points, which are shared with the entire team. When a certain experience threshold is reached for a team, each hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified statuses and gaining a talent point upon reaching levels 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20. Talent points allow players to customize their hero's abilities and generally result in large increase in power, especially for levels 10 and 20. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork, since a player's action can affect the whole team. Players can also mount different creatures, such as horses or unicorns, to increase their movement speed, automatically unmounting when dealing/receiving damage or using an ability. Minions at neutral camps can be defeated to gain mercenaries that fight for the player. Each map has a different side-objective that will help either team deal significant damage to the other.", developer: "Blizzard Entertainment", release_date: "June 2 2015", rating: "T"},

Characters can choose from a variety of professions, such as tailoring, blacksmithing, or mining. Characters can learn four secondary skills: archeology, cooking, fishing, and first-aid.

Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the actual sights on the gun for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are controllable by the player.\n\nThe game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of health reflected by a health bar.

The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities—Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus—to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional \"recon\" missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include: eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing and completing tasks for informers and fellow assassins. Additionally, the player may take part in any number of side objectives in these open world environments, including climbing tall towers to map out the city, and saving citizens who are being threatened or harassed by the city guards. There are also various side quests that do not advance the plot such as hunting down and killing Templars and flag collecting. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.", developer: "Ubisoft Montreal", release_date: "November 13, 2007", rating: "M"},

The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, Rome (The Vatican only) and the Tuscan countryside. The Animus 2.0, a new version of the machine of the same name present in Assassin's Creed, provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries.[1] More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies).\n\nThe player may now swim in water, and Eagle Vision—the ability to identify specific people and landmarks—can now be used in third-person view and while moving. A young Leonardo da Vinci is present in the game, aiding the player by creating new weapons from translated \"Codex pages\" that Altaïr, the original game's main character, left behind for future Assassins' analysis and insight. Within the game, the player will be able to use Leonardo's flying machine (based on real-life plans by Leonardo) during one mission. The player also has the ability to control a carriage in one level, and can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The setting of the various places the player may go to have been made more detailed and in-depth; civilians sometimes cough or sneeze. Additionally, the player can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves; these groups can be used to fight, distract, or lure guards, respectively. A day and night cycle has been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time, in addition to setting missions and events at certain times of the day.\n\nThere are many ways to interact with NPCs. Money thrown to the ground, or a corpse carried and then deposited on the ground, may also serve as a distraction for both guards and peasants. There are also several different types of enemies, some more agile or stronger than others, and some of which will actively search hiding places where Ezio was last seen.", developer: "Ubisoft Montreal", release_date: "November 17, 2009", rating: "M"},

The game is split up into levels, through which the player must progress one at a time to proceed in the game. The player is given a certain amount of lives, which are lost when Crash is attacked by an enemy or falls into water or a pit. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the \"Game Over\" screen will appear, in which the player can continue from the last time they saved their progress by selecting \"Yes\".\n\nCrash has the ability to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, as well as the ability to spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen. An enemy that is attacked by Crash's spin attack can be launched into another enemy that is on-screen at the same time. These same techniques can be used to open the numerous boxes found in each stage. Most boxes in the game contain Wumpa Fruit, which give the player an extra life if 100 of them are collected. Another item found inside crates is the Witch Doctor's Mask, which shields Crash from one enemy attack. Collecting three of these masks in a row grants Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers. Arrow boxes (marked with arrows pointing up) propel Crash further than his ordinary jump can, while TNT boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on. Boxes with an exclamation mark (!) on them cause previously intangible objects in the area to solidify. Check Point boxes allow Crash to return to the point where the first Check Point box has been opened upon losing a life.

  {title: "Borderlands", author_id: 1, description: "Borderlands includes character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading Gearbox to call the game a \"role-playing shooter\". At the start of the game, players select one of four characters, each with a unique special skill and with proficiencies with certain weapons. The four characters are: Roland the Soldier, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren, and Brick the Berserker. From then on, players take on missions assigned through non-player characters or from bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points, money, and sometimes a reward item. Players earn experience by killing both human and non-human foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then allocate skill points into a skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character; for example, Mordecai can become specialized in sniping, gunslinging with revolvers, or using his pet Bloodwing to assist in kills and health boosting. Players can distribute points among any of the specializations, and can also spend a small amount of in-game money to redistribute their skill points.\n\nThe game can be played alone, but also supports two-player cooperative play through split-screen (on consoles), and up to four players playing co-operatively online or over LAN. The game follows the progress of the host player, rewarding the other active players for completion of quests for their characters. If the other players are doing the same quests in their campaign, the completed quests remain the same in their campaign as well as the host's. When more players are present, the game alters the statistics of the generated enemies, balancing the game due to the larger number of players. Players can take part in one-on-one duels anywhere in the game world, or can visit arenas in the game world to participate in free-for-all, 2-on-2 or 3-on-1 combat battles with their fellow players.", developer: "Gearbox Software", release_date: "October 20, 2009", rating: "M"},

The player can use his or her Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During battle, the player may select a maneuver for his or her Pokémon to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up. A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.\n\nCatching Pokémon is another essential element of the gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures. Pokémon Yellow allows players to trade Pokémon between two cartridges via a Game Link Cable, including the previous games Pokémon Red and Blue. This method of trading must be done to fully complete the Pokédex, since each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team.\n\nPokémon Yellow features several enhancements and changes. Including the below-mentioned inclusion of Pikachu as the only available Pokémon to start with, Pikachu is given both a voice and a personality unique from other Pokémon. It follows the player on the overworld, and can be examined by speaking to it. While it initially has an indifferent opinion of the player, it can grow to love or hate him based on the player's actions; leveling up will keep Pikachu happy, while fainting frequently will make it unhappy (this enhanced feature would be used again in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver). There is an area in Pokémon Yellow that features a \"Surfing Pikachu\" mini-game. In order to play it, players must have a Pikachu who can learn \"Surf\", a Water-based attack. At the time, players could only accomplish this by winning a contest to get a \"surfing Pikachu\". However, if players use their Pikachu from Yellow in Pokémon Stadium and beat a certain mode under the proper circumstances, they are rewarded with the move Surf, which can be used both in battle, out of battle, and in the above-mentioned mini-game.

FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nAs with all Pokémon role-playing games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, in which the player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During battle, the player may select a move for his or her Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.\n\nCapturing Pokémon is another essential element of the gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.\n\nWhile FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (Pokémon Green was only released in Japan, whereas the American version was Blue), they contain usability enhancements such as a contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data at any point in the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.", developer: "Game Freak", release_date: "September 9, 2004", rating: "E"},

It is an enhanced remake of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.\n\nPlayers control a Pokémon trainer, whose general goal is to traverse the Hoenn region and conquer a series of eight Pokémon gyms in order to challenge the Elite Four and its champion. Players capture creatures called Pokémon along the way using Poké Balls and use them to fight other trainers' Pokémon. It keeps Pokémon that debuted in Ruby and Sapphire while incorporating Pokémon from Pokémon Gold and Silver in the after-game, that were not featured in Ruby and Sapphire. It features the same plot of Ruby and Sapphire except it incorporates the Pokémon Rayquaza into the story and introduces the Battle Frontier, a tournament in which players' characters can participate after the game's credits.\n\nThe setting and plot remains largely the same as Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. Players can choose from either a boy or girl (both of whom have been given new green costumes) and choose between one of three Pokémon before they proceed into the rest of the game's world. Players are tasked with filling a device called a Pokédex by catching different Pokémon species and evolving them. They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and its champion by battling their Pokémon. Along their journey they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua (whereas Ruby and Sapphire had you face only one of them based on which version you had). Each has a goal to change the world to their liking; Magma desires more landmass while Aqua desires more water. They plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre. Late in the game, they both summon their respective legendary Pokémon; however the Pokémon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly switching state of droughts and rain. The players' character climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza, who quells the other two Pokémon's rage. After players beat the Elite Four, they are able to encounter two Pokémon flying across Hoenn called Latias and Latios and can access an area called the Battle Frontier.", developer: "Game Freak", release_date: "May 1, 2005", rating: "E"},

The games are crossover titles that feature characters, items, music, and stages from various Nintendo franchises such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Pokémon, Kirby, Metroid, Star Fox, The Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus, as well as from third-party franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Mega Man, Pac-Man, and Street Fighter. New features include having up to eight players fighting at a time on the Wii U, using Miis as fighters, and the addition of customizable special moves unlockable for every character.

The game centers around characters known as \"Inklings\"—beings that can transform between humanoid and squid forms, and hide or swim through colored ink sprayed on surfaces using gun or brush-based weaponry. Splatoon features several gamemodes, including 4-on-4 online multiplayer and a single player campaign.\n\nSplatoon received positive reviews upon its unveiling and release, with critics praising Nintendo's decision to enter the genre with a new intellectual property (IP), the game's overall style and presentation, gameplay mechanics, and its soundtrack. Criticism was directed at the exclusion of voice chat and private lobbies—features that are commonplace in the genre of multiplayer shooters, the small number of multiplayer maps, and issues with online matchmaking. Splatoon debuted to strong sales, debuting at number one and two respectively on sales charts in Japan and the United Kingdom; 144,000 copies were sold during its launch week in Japan, and the game was the fastest-selling new IP on the Wii U in the United Kingdom. As of June 30, 2015, 1.62 million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.\n\nSplatoon is primarily a team-based third-person shooter which is playable by up to eight players in online four-versus-four matches, although the game also features local one-versus-one multiplayer matches and a single player campaign. Players control characters called Inklings, who have the ability to shape-shift between humanoid and squid forms. In humanoid form, Inklings can shoot ink in their team's color, which can be used to cover the environment or \"splat\" opposing players or enemies. Transforming into a squid allows players to swim through ink of their own color, even up walls and through grates, hiding from the enemy and replenishing their ink supply in the process. Conversely, enemy ink is much slower to move across in humanoid form and cannot be swum through in squid form. Players can use their ink to try and \"splatter\" their opponents, which will send them back to their team's respawn point whilst also providing a large splat of ink.

The player does this by completing free hunts on the island, where they collect materials and slay or capture monsters which are converted into resources that can be used to improve the village, and by completing time-limited quests for the Guild, typically slaying or capturing a monster in a specific region, for in-game money and material resources that can be used to improve their equipment that allows them to take on more difficult monsters. Improving the village gives the player access to a farming area and a fishing fleet, from which raw resources can be harvested, companions that can help while on the field, and access to a trader that can provide rare items to the player.\n\nThe player's character does not have any innate statistics but instead gains these from the equipment they outfit the character in. In particular, the player selects from one of ten weapon classes, primarily divided into melee weapons like swords and hammers, and ranged weapons like bows and bowguns. Each weapon type has a unique style of play when used in the field; sword users need to build up consecutive attacks to increase a combo meter to inflict larger damage on their foes but must keep an eye on their blade's sharpness, while bowmen can perform weak but fast ranged attacks including applying special coatings to their arrows to inflict debuffs on enemies. The player can also equip different sets of armor, which impart attack and defensive bonuses. Some weapons and armor include slots that gem decorations can be slotted into which boosts the item's statistics. Various armor pieces give special skill boosts, and if the player can equip a set that boosts a skill past set thresholds, they can gain additional passive bonuses such as full resistance to fire or poison attacks. The player can swap weapons and armor outside of adventuring.\n\nTo progress in the game, the player is typically required to collect parts of the larger monsters that they are assigned to kill, and using those to forge or upgrade weapons and armor. By being able to take on higher-ranked Guild quests with improved equipment, the player will gain access to a larger array of monster parts and world resources that lead to better equipment they can then craft.\n\nIn the field, the player has a health and stamina meter, as well as an item pouch with limited space where resources like healing potions, bombs, and materials picked up in the field are stored. Certain materials can be combined to make more potent items, such as stronger healing potions. However, once the item pouch is full, the player must choose to discard or swap out items with new ones. As the player hunts, they will take damage from monsters; if their health drops to zero, they are rescued to a base camp where they can set off again, but after falling for a third time, they are returned to the village without any gains made while they were adventuring. The stamina meter drops after performing most intensive actions like running, dodging, or attacking, but restores when the player otherwise is walking around. When the player's stamina is depleted, the character will be forced to stop for a brief period to catch their breath before they can move, leaving them vulnerable to attack. In addition, the maximum stamina that the player has will drop over time while in the field, though certain items can restore the maximum stamina level. While on free hunts, the player can leave the field and return to the village at any time, keeping any items they have collected; on Quest hunts, failure to complete the mission in time or abandoning the quest foregoes any reward items.", developer: "Capcom Production Studio 1", release_date: "April 20, 2010", rating: "T"},

While there is a much stronger emphasis on combat than other games in the Legend of Zelda series, the player may use common weapons from prior games in the series, such as a sword, bombs, and Link's signature spin attack. Enemy targeting also returns, in combination with elements from the Dynasty Warriors combat system. Obtaining items through discovering and opening chests is retained as well.\n\nThe game has a context-based combat system, in which the player character's abilities change depending on the weapon chosen. Role-playing elements such as weapon and character leveling also appear. Defeating certain enemies gives players weapons bags, which will grant a random weapon to the character, and materials bags, which can be used to power up characters. \"Sealed weapons\" may also be found in treasure boxes, which increase the types of weapons randomly generated for the player in the field. The game supports an asymmetric local two-player mode with one player using the Wii U GamePad and another using a monitor. The game is also compatible with Amiibo figures, with figures based on The Legend of Zelda series unlocking additional content such as new weapons.\n\nThe main campaign of Hyrule Warriors, \"Legend Mode\", allows players to progress through the game's story; these story chapters can be replayed with any character in \"Free Mode\". Additionally, the game features an \"Adventure Mode\", in which players explore a map based on that of the original The Legend of Zelda and complete specific objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a time limit or completing a mission with a specific character and weapon.

Both games were re-released on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on February 27, 2013 and in North America and Europe on May 30, 2013. The games feature a brighter color palette when played on a Nintendo Game Boy Advance in order to make up for the darkness of the screen, and a special shop is also made available. After experimenting with porting the original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games that could be played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game.\n\nThe player controls Link from an overhead perspective, with the same control scheme from The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for the Game Boy. In Seasons, the Triforce transports Link to the land of Holodrum, where he sees Onox kidnap Din, the Oracle of Seasons. In Ages, the Triforce transports Link to Labrynna, where Veran possesses Nayru. The main plot is revealed once the player finishes both games. Link is armed with a sword and shield as well as a variety of secondary weapons and items for battling enemies and solving puzzles. The central items are the Rod of Seasons, which controls the seasons in Holodrum, and the Harp of Ages, which lets Link travel through time in Labrynna.

Link is transported to a forest in the land of Labrynna, where he hears screaming. In a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest.[9] Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, surrounded by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.\n\nLink receives a sword from Impa and makes his way to the Maku Tree in Lynna City, the capital of Labrynna. The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; Link uses a time portal to travel to the past to prevent this. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Time to defeat Veran. Link sets out to retrieve the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, Link is told he has the opportunity to save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi. Link gathers the remaining Essences and brings them to the Maku Tree, who uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed that allows Link to enter Veran's Black Tower. Link ascends the tower and defeats Veran. He rescues Queen Ambi, and Nayru tells him that all has returned to normal.

  {title: "The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons", author_id: 1, description: "The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages are two action-adventure games in the Legend of Zelda series, developed by Flagship (a subsidiary of Capcom). They were released on February 27, 2001 in Japan, May 14, 2001 in North America, and October 5, 2001 in Europe for Nintendo's Game Boy Color handheld console. Both games were re-released on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on February 27, 2013 and in North America and Europe on May 30, 2013. The games feature a brighter color palette when played on a Nintendo Game Boy Advance in order to make up for the darkness of the screen, and a special shop is also made available. After experimenting with porting the original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games that could be played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game.\n\nThe player controls Link from an overhead perspective, with the same control scheme from The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for the Game Boy. In Seasons, the Triforce transports Link to the land of Holodrum, where he sees Onox kidnap Din, the Oracle of Seasons. In Ages, the Triforce transports Link to Labrynna, where Veran possesses Nayru. The main plot is revealed once the player finishes both games. Link is armed with a sword and shield as well as a variety of secondary weapons and items for battling enemies and solving puzzles. The central items are the Rod of Seasons, which controls the seasons in Holodrum, and the Harp of Ages, which lets Link travel through time in Labrynna. Before he can infiltrate Onox's castle and Veran's tower, Link must collect the eight Essences of Nature and the eight Essences of Time, which are hidden in dungeons and guarded by bosses.\n\nSeasons begins as the Triforce calls out to Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link approaches it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A funnel cloud drops from the sky, taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.\n\nDin's attendant, Impa, tells Link that they were headed for Hyrule; she instructs him to see the Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link retrieves the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.", developer: "Capcom, Flagship", release_date: "May 14, 2001", rating: "E"},

  {title: "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening", author_id: 1, description: "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is a 1993 action-adventure video game developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the fourth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series, and the first for a handheld game console.\n\nUnlike most The Legend of Zelda titles, Link‍ '​s Awakening is set outside the kingdom of Hyrule. It omits locations and characters from previous games, aside from protagonist Link and a passing mention of Princess Zelda. Instead, the game takes place entirely on Koholint Island, an isolated landmass cut off from the rest of the world. The island, though small, contains a large number of secrets and interconnected pathways.\n\nIn Link‍ '​s Awakening, the player is given advice and directions by non-player characters such as Ulrira, a shy old man who communicates with Link exclusively by telephone. The game contains cameo appearances by characters from other Nintendo titles, such as Wart, Yoshi, Kirby, Dr. Wright (renamed Mr. Write) from the Super Nintendo version of SimCity, and the exiled prince Richard from Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru. Chomp, an enemy from the Mario series, was included after a programmer gave Link the ability to grab the creature and take it for a walk. Enemies from Super Mario Bros. such as Goombas also appear in underground side-scrolling sections; Link may land on top of them much as with Super Mario Bros., or he can attack them in the usual way: both methods yield different bonuses. Director Takashi Tezuka said that the game's \"freewheeling\" development made Link's Awakening seem like a parody of The Legend of Zelda series. Certain characters in the game break the fourth wall; for example, little children inform the player of game mechanics such as saving, but state that they do not understand their own advice.", developer: "Nintendo EAD", release_date: "December 15, 1998", rating: "E"},

  {title: "Grand Theft Auto", author_id: 1, description: "Grand Theft Auto is an open world action-adventure video game developed by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) and published by BMG Interactive. It was first released in Europe and North America in October 1997 for DOS and Microsoft Windows. It was later re-released on 14 December 1997 in Europe and 30 June 1998 in North America for the PlayStation. It is the first instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, a series that has sold more than 150 million units as of September 2013. The story follows a group of criminals in three fictionalised versions of US cities as they perform bank robberies, assassinations, and other crimes for their respective syndicates.\n\nGrand Theft Auto is made up of six levels split between the three main cities. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a target number of points, which is typically achieved by performing tasks for the city's local crime syndicate. Each level is initiated at a telephone box and has its own unique set of tasks. Successful completion of a mission rewards the player with points and opens the opportunity to attempt harder missions for higher rewards, while failure awards fewer points and may permanently seal off opportunities for more tasks. Completing missions also increases the player's \"multiplier\", which increases the points the player gets for doing other tasks. When the player amasses a total of $1,000,000, the next city is unlocked.\n\nThere are eight playable characters in the game, four male and four female: Travis, Troy, Bubba, Kivlov, Ulrika, Katie, Divine, and Mikki (the PlayStation version only includes the four male characters, however). In actual gameplay, there is no real difference, since all player-characters wear the identical yellow jumper, although they do wear different coloured trousers and hair colours to each other and have the correct skin colours. Players may also name their character which, with the correct name, acts like a cheat code and alters gameplay.\n\nThe player is free to do whatever they want, but have limited lives upon doing so. The player can gain points by causing death and destruction amid the traffic in the city, or steal and sell cars for profit. To get to the large target money required to complete a level, players will usually opt to complete at least some missions to build up their multiplier. Some criminal acts have an inherent multiplier; for example, using a police car for running over people doubles the number of points received. If the player is arrested then their multiplier is halved. Unlike in later games in the series, the player can be wasted in one hit without body armour. If the player is wasted then they lose a life. In both cases the player loses their current equipment. If the player is wasted too many times, they must restart the level.", developer: "DMA Design", release_date: "February 28, 1998", rating: "M"},

  {title: "Grand Theft Auto 2", author_id: 1, description: "Grand Theft Auto 2 retained the overhead viewpoint of Grand Theft Auto, as well as the car-stealing/telephone-answering formula of the original. The player has the ability to explore cities on foot or in various vehicles. The aim is to achieve a certain score. On achieving this goal the player then can proceed to the next level. Doing missions awards the player more points than any other method but are not essential for completion of the game.\n\nA new feature introduced in Grand Theft Auto 2 was doing missions for separate gangs, of which there are two new gangs for each of the three levels of the game, and one faction which is present in all levels. Being employed by one gang can cause distrust from others (working for gang #1 will incur the wrath of gang #2, working for gang #2 will cause enmity with gang #3, etc.). In the original Grand Theft Auto, only the local police pursued the player. In Grand Theft Auto 2, SWAT teams (4 Copheads) are introduced in the Downtown District, while Special Agents (5 Copheads) and the army (6 Copheads) are introduced in the Residential and Industrial Districts. These additional types of law enforcement begin chasing the player as his or her wanted level increases. The wanted level is represented by images of a cop's head, and vary between the Windows and PlayStation versions.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 2 introduced an improved saving technique, unlike the original game, which saved only when finishing a city. If the player entered a church with $50,000, a voice announced \"Hallelujah! Another soul saved!\". This notified the player that the game had been saved. If the player did not have enough money, the voice would say \"Damnation! No donation, no salvation!\". These messages are not heard on the PlayStation version.\n\nOther improvements pertain to city activity. Passing vehicles and pedestrians are no longer cosmetic parts of the environment, but actually play a role in gameplay. Sometimes pedestrians would occasionally enter and ride in taxis or buses. The game is noted for the behaviour of its non-player characters. Pedestrians, gang members and the police would occasionally engage in fights, and there are other carjackers (Green sweater) and muggers (Red sweater with white arms) in the city.\n\nThis game introduces 'side missions' such as being a taxi driver, bus driver, and a semi-truck driver along with retrieving 'hidden' packages ('GTA2' Badges) or Wang Cars (play on 'wankers'), and a health meter. Being a taxidriver would earn roughly 1 dollar per second. When standing still, passengers could get out if they want to, and the earnings will stop. Wang Cars only appeared in the second district. They were well hidden and usually required the player to take a severe amount of highspeed jumps to reach the cars, some of them parked on top of buildings. When the car was entered, the player spawned at the Wang Cars garage, with the garagedoor of the collected car lighting up. Collecting all cars resulted in 8 bonus vehicles parked outside the garage. Among these were cars prepped with oilslicks, integrated machineguns and a firetruck, living up its name as its watercannon was replaced with a flamethrower.", developer: "DMA Design", release_date: "September 30, 1999", rating: "M"},

The player must restart the current level if Spider-Man runs out of health, falls off a building, or fails to complete certain objectives such as rescuing a hostage. Spider-Man is able to utilize his spider powers to traverse the environments, being able to crawl on walls and ceilings, swing short distances and instantly zip between certain points. In combat, Spider-Man can utilize a limited supply of web-cartridges to attack his enemies, either webbing them up to stall or defeat them, increasing the strength of his attacks, or forming an explosive barrier.

Levels are in \"sections\" with a different enemy for each, each section lasting about 3 levels. Each level, except for the last two, has a bonus screen after it. Generally, there are the bonuses \"Time\" (clear level in a set time), \"Perfect\" (Not take damage/detected) and \"Style\" (use as many combos as possible). Other level-specific ones are \"Secrets\" (Uncover a secret area), \"Combat\" (Defeat all enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on completing these tasks. On Sidekick mode, each bonus is 500 points, Hero is 700, and Super-Hero is 1000 each.\n\nThe basic abilities are swinging, zipping, punching and kicking, web, camera lock, and the Web Mode in Enhanced Mode. Depending on how the player combines different buttons, it makes different effects. Wall-crawling is automatic, and players are also able to lift up heavy and light objects such as cars and chairs. There are 21 different combat combos which Gold Spiders are used to gain these combos, with 4 web controls, each having a type of \"upgrade\" to each. There is also \"stealth mode\", where Spider-Man is in shadow, and therefore is undetectable by enemies.

Unlockable costumes for Spider-Man include Peter Parker in his civilian clothes, the homemade wrestling outfit from the movie, and acclaimed comic book artist Alex Ross' prototype design for the movie Spider-Man costume, which also triggers the Goblin to wear Ross' early design during battles.

The game includes a co-op multiplayer mode, as Spider-Man or a sidekick, in locations around the globe, including Tokyo, Egypt, and Nepal.", developer: "Next Level Games, Beenox, A2M", release_date: "October 2, 2007", rating: "T"},

{title: "The Amazing Spider-Man", author_id: 1, description: "The game has an open world/free-roaming concept. The combat system is reminiscent of the Rocksteady Studios-developed Batman game series (Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City) using a freeflow design and counterattacks. Beenox took a cue from the Batman games, with Dee Brown, the head of Beenox, stating \"I played both Batman games and liked them. For me, the Spider-Man character is very different than Batman. You have to approach both in a different way. I think the Rocksteady guys did a good job at providing what was required to make a great Batman game, and we're doing everything we need to this time to make a great Spider-Man game.\"\n\nPlayers can collect full, vintage comic books, such as Amazing Fantasy #15, as they collect comic covers throughout the game.\n\nThe game uses a unique damage system—the more damage Spider-Man takes, the more his suit is damaged; returning to the 'hub' area repairs the suit. By finding different spider symbols in certain parts of New York and taking photos of them, alternate costumes can be unlocked, such as \"Big Time\" Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider (Kaine), a color-inverted version of the Future Foundation costume, the original movie trilogy red and blue suit when you get the Stan Lee pre-order DLC or Rhino pre-order DLC, the Spider-Man 3 black suit, a new version of the black suit and a party hat for Spidey's 50th anniversary, which can be changed when the player goes to Peter Parker's apartment, though, there are some exceptions to the Wii U edition, as you have to COMPLETE the missions.\n\nMany DLC packs have been released for this version. One of these is the \"Lizard Rampage pack,\" where players play as the Lizard and destroying guards. The \"Rhino Challenge pack\" has players control the Rhino character, destroying cars and thugs. The \"Oscorp Search and Destroy pack\" has two minigames with similar gameplay to Snake and Space Invaders. The final DLC pack is the \"Stan Lee Adventure pack\", in which players can play as Stan Lee (with Spider-Man's powers). There are also many in-game references to characters in other franchises (e.g. Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Captain America).", developer: "Other Ocean Interactive, Beenox, Gameloft", release_date: "June 26, 2012", rating: "T"},

{title: "The Amazing Spider-Man 2", author_id: 1, description: "The game retains its open world gameplay of previous entries in the franchise. The game's free roam area of Manhattan is more expansive, spacious and detailed than that of the previous game's, and most of the story takes place in the open world. In addition to advanced combat and upgrades, there is different types of webbing (example, the player can use different webbings to freeze or blow up something on impact), and web-slinging is similar to that of Spider-Man 2 and its subsequent based games. Unlike the previous game, all versions of the game have free roam, with the exception of the 3DS version, which is a side-scrolling game in the same vein as previous Nintendo DS Spider-Man games. The PS4 version can be played on the PS Vita using remote play, with optimized controls.\n\nThe game re-innovated the web swinging mechanic, allowing for a more interactive and engaging experience swinging through New York City's open world. Unlike The Amazing Spider-Man video game, the player's webs will appear to attach to buildings, although it still attaches to thin-air allowing the player to swing from anywhere in the city, regardless of whether buildings are present. Now the player is only limited to the space around them in order to swing properly; if there is no object a web can attach to, the player will be unable to web swing and fall. Additionally, the method of web-swinging has also been changed. Players playing on console systems will now web swing using the left and right triggers of the controllers. The left and right triggers take control of Spider-Man's left and right hands, respectively (example, if a building appears on the left, the player is better suited to use the left trigger and if one appears on the right, the player would be better suited to use the right trigger to swing.) Both triggers can be held at the same time which allows players to boost Spider-Man´s swing speed.\n\nMorality is used in a new system known as \"Hero or Menace\" where players will be rewarded for stopping crimes or punished for not consistently doing so or not responding. The player is able to upgrade Spider-Man's web shooters. During certain sections of the game, the player can control Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker and walk around doing detective work.\n\nPlayers have access to Peter Parker's home, and his room allows players to replay previous missions from the main storyline, purchase upgrades and equip the various costumes available. Audio logs of many characters can be collected from all around the city. Players can use the Metro to go back to Peter Parker's home.\n\nAdditionally, new enemy types have been introduced. Armored guards can be taken down either with a stealth attack or by the Ionic Web upgrade, which allows players to break down armor, thus leaving the guard vulnerable to damage.\n\nFurthermore, the city has been expanded to incorporate unique districts that allow for more open space to the player. The crimes from the first game have been expanded on, but it also includes new crimes such as arson and hostage situations. The crimes also progress dynamically, such as fighting criminals on the street then chasing one that gets away in a vehicle. Unlike the previous game, there will be constant random side activities. Additionally, the use of the Web-Rush system returns and has been expanded on from the previous game, now allowing for critical strikes, dodges and rolls. There are also new upgrades and abilities introduced into the game, some of which have been expanded on from the previous game.", developer: "Gameloft, Beenox, High Voltage Software", release_date: "April 17, 2014", rating: "T"},

Review.create!([
  {author_id: 1, game_id: 1, body: "I never really played this game as a child when it came out, but as I was studying at App Academy, this was my favorite past-time during lunch. It's amazing how much value it retains because even now in 2015, I can still enjoy this game as long as other's are enjoying it with me. I think the basic game is just enjoyable and perhaps the future editions may as well be, but for now, I'd still to the good old ~20 characters instead of the new editions with 50 characters.", rating: 5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 33, body: "This is a classic game for sure. I played it during elementary school and it was probably the most popular thing for children at the time. The game was so easy to learn and you could even battle other people if you had a link cable. The console itself may have sucked because it drained battery and there were no rechargable batteries at the time, but it was worth it to play. There are a whole load of new pokemon now but this is certainly worth playing even if you have only played the new ones. The graphics are good for the time period when the game was released.", rating: 4.5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 35, body: "Like the other pokemon games, this is one you can enjoy. It sort of follows the same plot and story as the blue and red versions, except you get to start out with a PIKACHU. It's tough to beat the Pewter City gym at the beginning because electric is weak against rock and ground, but after that obstacle, the game is easy going and of course, always enjoyable. Another classic RPG gem and highly recommended for all RPG and pokemon lovers out there.", rating: 5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 14, body: "For those without consoles and looking to enjoy a popular MMORPG out there for casual entertainment, Runescape 2 is the way to go. It's predecessor, Runescape 1, was also a good one to play, but Runescape 2 is just a whole level above it. The gameplay is almost the same, but it has a better user interface and is easy to adapt/learn. The game is run in a browser so you do not need to download anything and is not graphically intensive so you don't need a top-tier gaming system to run this. It is grind-heavy but then again, what RPG isn't?", rating: 4},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 15, body: "This game is probably the worst out of all the Runescape games. Jagex heavily modified Runescape 2 into what they percieve to be a better and more marketable game. Most of the old RPG elements were kept, however, the UI heavily mimicks World of Warcraft style gaming with the usage of the keyboard rather than the mouse (as in previous Runescape games). I would not play this game and there are way better alternatives. You could probably choose any MMORPG out there and it would be the same style of gameplay but better graphics.", rating: 2},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 25, body: "Borderlands 2 is a gem of it's own. The gameplay and humor are original to almost every other game I have played. They also have nice easter eggs referencing 'modern-day' events. Remember the game was released I think in 2012 so perhaps the references might be outdated now. Single player is enjoyable, however, playing with your friend in multiplayer mode is WAYYY more fun. There is an in-game voice chat system (if you have a mic), and to play the game together while talking in real time is truly the way to go here. There are bosses to hunt and tons of missions to complete. The game also has a very high replay value to me personally.", rating: 5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 4, body: "DOTA 2 as most of us know it is a MOBA style game with an extremely high learning curve. If you have experience playing other MOBAs such as League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm, it will be easier to pick up, but still tough nevertheless. I have played this game since it came out as a custom game in Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos, and I still enjoy it. The only issue is that the game is heavily dependent on teamwork and if your team is uncooperative, you basically lose. There is a nice in-game voice chat system so you can talk instead of typing. That said, it's awesome to play when you have a group of friends who can work together. Another downside is that games tend to take more than 30 minutes so don't start unless you can commit. Leavers are penalized if they leave too much.", rating: 4.5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 5, body: "Heroes of the Storm is another MOBA style game like DOTA and LoL except the game revolves around objectives rather than 'farming' monsters for gold and experience. The game does not feature items or in game gold to buy items so teamwork is heavily emphasized. The objectives are the main source of experience so working together is not optional. Remember that killing the other team may put you slightly ahead, but more kills does not mean you will win the game. OBJECTIVES ARE IMPORTANT!", rating: 4.5},

  {author_id: 1, game_id: 11, body: "Maple Story is a platform 2D mmorpg style game with cute cartoon like graphics. You can choose from a variety of classes depending on what you prefer and there are multiple styles your default character can look like. The game is almost entirely keyboard based and sort of reminiscent of old platform games such as mario. There are bosses you can choose to fight with a party and even lots of socializing features such as hanging out in the market or getting married in game. This game does feature a special currency you can get with real currency but does not necessarily give the player an edge. This 'real' currency is mainly used to dress the character in better looking clothes and will not give them better statistics. All game material can be completed as a free to play player.", rating: 5},
  {author_id: 1, game_id: 2, body: "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is my go-to FPS game of all time (unless they come out with a new one). Playing on the PC is unlike playing on the consoles, which I believe is mainly dead because of other games like CoD and BF which trump CSGO on the consoles. It is probably the most popular fps game on the PC and is not a game you can pick up easily. There is a high skill cap and no auto-aim (sorry console players) so it actually takes a decent amount of practice to get good. If you rage easily or get frustrated because you can't win all the time, this game is not for you. If you are looking for a mature style of play with mainly older teenagers and adults, this is it.", rating: 5},
  {author_id: 1, game_id: 8, body: "Pokemon Ruby was probably the first game I put over 1000 hours of gameplay into. I'm not even talking about the time that I just left the game on without playing, but I really invested 1000 hours into this game because it is just so good. As a newer generation pokemon game, it does kind of suck not to be able to capture all the older generation pokemon, but you can trade those pokemon into this game if you also have a leaf green or fire red pokemon version. This game was a major upgrade from silver and gold with lots of new features such as different types of bikes and new pokemon types and moves. The graphics are mainly the same except with better colors and drawings. Gameplay is exactly the same which is basically what you want to do with these series type of games.", rating: 5},
  {author_id: 1, game_id: 32, body: "This game is probably more tailored to those who actually enjoy baseball. Watching the game live is already pretty boring to me, but to play the game offers me no source of entertainment. Im not saying that this game sucks, but I simply don't enjoy this type of gameplay where you just hit a button to swing the bat or run your player to try and catch the ball. This is simply just not a very fun game and I would rather play the NBA series because at least there is some form of action in those games.", rating: 2.5},
  {author_id: 1, game_id: 20, body: "Super Mario is a classic no matter what year it is and what new features they implement into the game. It is the epitome of what a platformer shoud look like and is enjoyable regardless of how old the game is. I played super mario on the SNES system and the original game boy system and the game has yet to disappoint.", rating: 5},
